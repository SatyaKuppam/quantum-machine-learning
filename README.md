# Examples in Quantum Machine Learning

This repository containes examples for quantum computing applications in machine learning.

Currently contains:

### Classification
   * [Heirarchical Quantum Classifiers by Grant et al.](https://github.com/SatyaKuppam/quantum-machine-learning/blob/master/classification/%5BGrant%20et%20al.%5D%20Heirarchical%20Quantum%20Classifiers.ipynb): MERA and TTN inspired PQC for binary classification on IRIS and MNIST datasets.
   * [Quantum Kitchen Sinks by Wilson et al.](https://github.com/SatyaKuppam/quantum-machine-learning/blob/master/classification/%5BWilson%20et%20al.%5D%20Quantum%20Kitchen%20Sinks.ipynb): Contains a quantum kitchen sinks example for binary classification on MNIST.

### Gradients:
* Example for finding gradients using the [parameter shift method](https://github.com/SatyaKuppam/quantum-machine-learning/blob/master/parameter_shift/parameter_shift_gradient_descent.ipynb) to find the parameters of a PQC that minimize a cost functino.

### Libraries used:
tensorflow-quantum, scipy, sklearn, keras, cirq, qiskit

### To-Do:

  * Add noise models for simulations.
  * QEC with Quantum Convolutional Neural networks from Cong et al.
  * Universal discriminative quantum neural networks by Chen et al.
  * Circuit-centric quantum classifiers by Schuld et al.
  * Quantum Boltzmann machines
  * Quantum Circuit Born machine
  * Quantum Neural Networks to simulate many-body physics by Gardas et al.
  * Generative models from [Bendetti's PhD Thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10086495/1/Benedetti_phd_thesis_ecopy.pdf)
